<p id="tribute-info">Dr. Angelou's Life and Awards, she was born 4th of april,1928 St. Louis, Missouri.In 1931 her parents split up when she was very young, and she and her older brother, Bailey, were sent to live with their father's mother, Anne Henderson, in Stamps, Arkansas. As an African American, Angelou experienced firsthand racial prejudices and discrimination in Arkansas. She also suffered at the hands of a family associate around the age of 7: During a visit with her mother, Angelou was raped by her mother's boyfriend. As vengeance for the sexual assault, Angelou's uncles killed the boyfriend. 
She later returned to high school, but became pregnant in her senior year and graduated a few weeks before giving birth to her son, Guy. She left home at 16 and took on the difficult life of a single mother, supporting herself and her son by working as a waitress and cook, but she had not given up on her talents for music, dance, performance and poetry.
 In 1952 she married Tosh Angelous a Greek sailor but the marriage lasted for a few years Angelou's career as a performer began to take off. She landed a role in a touring production of Porgy and Bess, later appearing in the off-Broadway production Calypso Heat Wave (1957) and releasing her first album, Miss Calypso (1957). 
Maya published her first autobiography called 'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'. The book tells the story of her life up until the age of seventeen. In the book, Maya captures the many struggles she went through growing up as an African-American woman in the mid-1900s. She also shows how she overcame these issues through character, books, and words. 
  Maya Angelou participated in a series of live broadcasts for Achievement Television in taking questions submitted by students from across the United States.      Maya continued to write up until her death on May 28, 2014 at the age of 86.
